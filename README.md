# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Hybrid Model
## Overview
This project introduces an advanced Credit Card Fraud Detection system employing a hybrid model. The hybrid model seamlessly combines an Autoencoder and a Classifier, achieving exceptional accuracy in fraud detection. This innovative approach capitalizes on the Autoencoder for feature learning and anomaly detection, while the Classifier fine-tunes the detection process.

## Key Features
### Hybrid Model Architecture: 
The system leverages a novel combination of an Autoencoder and a Classifier. The Autoencoder focuses on unsupervised feature learning, and the Classifier optimizes the detection process.

### Anomaly Detection through Autoencoder:
By learning normal patterns in credit card transactions during training, the Autoencoder effectively identifies anomalies, potentially indicating fraudulent activities.

### Classifier for Precision Enhancement:
The Classifier plays a crucial role in refining the detection process. It categorizes instances flagged by the Autoencoder, enhancing precision and minimizing false positives.

### High Accuracy: 
The system attains an impressive accuracy rate of 99%, underscoring its reliability in discerning fraudulent credit card transactions.

## How It Works
### Data Preprocessing:
The input data undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values and normalize features.

### Autoencoder Feature Learning:
During the training phase, the Autoencoder learns normal patterns prevalent in credit card transactions.

### Anomaly Detection:
Anomalies are pinpointed by detecting deviations from the learned normal patterns.

### Classifier Refinement:
The Classifier adds an extra layer of precision by refining results obtained from the Autoencoder.

### Evaluation:
The system's performance undergoes rigorous evaluation based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Achievements

### Accuracy:
